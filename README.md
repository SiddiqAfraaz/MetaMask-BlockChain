# Team MetaMask - BlockChain Storage

## Statement

Blockchain storage is a method of storing data in a decentralized network that makes use of idle Hard disk space from people all around the world. The patient's EMR (Electronic medical records) can be stored in a Blockchain using InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) protocol. This provides a more efficient way than standard cloud storage, enabling access to patients’ EMR scans from anywhere on the planet. Using MetaMask we planned to create our very own ERC20 token using the Ropsten Test Network. This token is issued as a reward to the people whose local storage is used. The generation of Cryptocurrency tokens takes place when certain criteria are satisfied and are maintained on a blockchain, known as Smart Contracts. Our ERC20 token works on the Proof-Of-Work algorithm. Unlike Bitcoin, our token’s POW is associated with data storage. The work done demonstrates that a miner has stored data for a specific time period.
